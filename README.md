# Hungry Midlothian

 ***Food for the Hearts***

## Introduction

 We were tasked with analysing, designing, and creating a prototype for a digital product to improve the experience of fans at match day. During our reasearch, we discovered that the current system for purchasing food is flawed and inefficient, costing fans time, and Hearts money. Our solution is a website that allows match-goers to order food before and during a match, cutting down on both queues and food waste, along with reducing the amount of cash handled by the kiosks, further reducing both cost and risk.
